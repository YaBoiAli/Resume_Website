# Website

This website is a visual of my coding skills and uses,

Javascript, Some Java, HTML, and CSS.

I worked on this website for 20+ hours since I

was learning javascript as I going through my project

In this website you can go from one page to another 

and has a volume knob to play and alter the volume.

Make sure when you have downloaded and set up NPM

Because you wont be able to run this otherwise, Since I havent hosted it yet

There were too many files for me to upload, and they wouldnt upload

So you need to have NPM installed and setup for this program to run
