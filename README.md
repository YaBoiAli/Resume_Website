# Website

This website is a visual of my coding skills and uses,

Javascript, Some Java, HTML, and CSS.

I worked on this website for 20+ hours since I

was learnging javascript as I was going with the website.

In this website you can go from one page to anouther 

and has a volume knob to play and alter the volume.

Make sure when you download you set up NPM, 

Because you wont be able to run this otherwise

There were too many files for me to upload, and they wouldnt upload

So you need to have NOM installed and setup for this program to run
